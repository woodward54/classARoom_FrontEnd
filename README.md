# classARoom_FrontEnd

A webAR app designed to teach the basics of AR design and development.

This repo is the front end react app. Users can add A-Frame primitive components, set properties such as color and height, and input their own
html tags to further customize their scene. When they are finished editing, the user can click "build" which sends the updated html code to the
A-Frame front end. The users comonents will be displayed on a printed out image target.
